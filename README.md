## Requirements

- Node.js 22.12.0 or higher
- Discord Bot Token
- Discord Application Client ID

## Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root (you can copy from `.env.example`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
```

For **production** (`NODE_ENV=production`), also set at least one bot owner ID (needed for `/owner` and operational control):

```env
BOT_OWNER_IDS=your_discord_user_id
```

See [.env.example](.env.example) for all configuration options and [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) for the full environment variable reference.

### 3. Get Discord Credentials

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Create a new application or select existing one
3. Go to "Bot" section and copy the token
4. **Enable Privileged Intents**: Go to "Bot" > Enable `SERVER MEMBERS INTENT`
5. Go to "OAuth2" > "General" and copy the Client ID
6. Go to "OAuth2" > "URL Generator":
   - Select scopes: `bot`, `applications.commands`
   - Select bot permissions: `Send Messages`, `Use Slash Commands`, `Embed Links`
   - Use the generated URL to invite the bot to your server

## Usage

### Development

Run the bot with hot-reload:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

Build and run:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Commands

### General

### Admin (`/admin`)

Requires **Manage Server** in the guild (slash command default permission).

| Command                                   | Description                                                    |

`language` sets the language the bot replies in for everyone in the server.
`auto` follows each user's own Discord client language, which is how the bot
behaves when nothing is configured.

### Community (`/community`)

| Command                                          | Description                             |

| `/community roulette team <count>`               | Divide voice channel members into teams |

**Options:**

- `question`: Poll question (required)
- `option1` to `option10`: Choices (at least 2 required, up to 10)
- `duration`: Duration in minutes (optional, unlimited if not set)
- `anonymous`: Anonymous voting (default: false)

### Voice (`/voice`)

| Command                             | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `/voice record <duration>`          | Record past audio from your voice channel     |
| `/voice status`                     | Show buffer window, auto-join state, capacity |
| `/voice autojoin enable`            | Allow the bot to join occupied voice channels |
| `/voice autojoin disable`           | Stop joining and buffering in this server     |
| `/voice autojoin exclude <channel>` | Keep the bot out of one voice channel         |
| `/voice autojoin include <channel>` | Remove a channel from the exclusion list      |

**Options:**

- `duration`: Recording duration (e.g., `30s`, `1m`, `5m`, max 5 minutes). A
  recording cannot be longer than `AUDIO_BUFFER_DURATION`, which is why raising
  that setting above `MAX_RECORDING_DURATION` only costs memory.

**Features:**

- Auto-join: Bot automatically joins voice channels when users enter, and keeps
  a rolling window of that channel's audio so `/voice record` can reach backwards
  in time
- Disclosure: on joining, the bot posts once into the voice channel's own text
  chat saying audio is being kept and how to turn it off
- Opt-out: `/voice autojoin disable` (whole server) or
  `/voice autojoin exclude <channel>` (one channel). Both also drop any
  connection already buffering
- In-memory ring buffer of `AUDIO_BUFFER_DURATION` seconds (default: 300 = 5
  minutes), about **82MB per voice channel**, allocated the first time someone
  actually speaks — a channel the bot sits in silently costs nothing. Multiply
  by `MAX_CONCURRENT_VC_CONNECTIONS` for the worst case when sizing your host
- WAV format output at 48kHz/16bit/mono (~27.5MB for 5 minutes)
- Private delivery: Recording responses and files are sent ephemerally
- Automatic file cleanup after `RECORDING_RETENTION_HOURS` (default: 24 hours)
- Memory monitoring against `MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` (RSS), disconnecting the oldest
  connections when usage passes 85% of the budget

**Notes:**

- Requires `Manage Server`
- Bot must be in the same voice channel
- Maximum concurrent VC connections: 5 (configurable)
- Opus decoding uses **`opusscript`** (pure JS) instead of `@discordjs/opus` so installs stay free of vulnerable native prebuild chains; CPU use can be higher than a native Opus build under heavy voice load. See [`docs/quality.md`](docs/quality.md) for dependency overrides.

### Memory

A voice channel holds a ring buffer in memory once it has carried audio:
roughly `AUDIO_BUFFER_DURATION × 0.27 MB` (about 82MB at the 300s default).
The buffer is allocated on the first decoded chunk, so connections that never
hear anything stay free, and it is released on disconnect. With
`MAX_CONCURRENT_VC_CONNECTIONS=5` the worst case is about 410MB on top of the
bot's baseline, so `MEMORY_LIMIT_MB` (default 512) should match what your host
actually grants the container.

### Data Retention

The bot keeps operational data for limited periods and cleans it up automatically.

- `RECORDING_RETENTION_HOURS`: recording files in `data/recordings/` (default: 24 hours)
- `VOICE_SESSION_RETENTION_DAYS`: completed VC session rows (default: 30 days)
- `AUDIT_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS`: audit log rows (default: 90 days)
- `BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS`: database backup files (default: 7 days)

See [`docs/database.md`](docs/database.md) for schema details and retention behavior.

## Project Structure

Feature-based architecture: each feature lives under `src/features/` and exports a lifecycle module from `index.ts`.

- `src/features/index.ts` is the single registry for feature startup and shutdown.
- `src/features/<feature>/commands/` contains only public slash command definitions.
- `src/features/<feature>/application/` is the internal command/application layer.
- `src/features/<feature>/repositories/` contains feature-specific persistence access.
- Feature runtime code should prefer explicit folders such as `integrations/`, `jobs/`, `recording/`, and `tracking/`; `services/` remains only where a smaller stateful boundary is clearer, such as `poll/services/`.
- `src/infrastructure/` contains shared runtime infrastructure such as database bootstrap, backup, health, and metrics.
- `src/shared/` contains cross-feature utilities, shared types, and the shared help catalog.
- `src/app-scripts/` contains TypeScript maintenance scripts, while root `scripts/` contains repo workflow shell scripts.

See [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full structure and lifecycle rules.

# Project Structure

The project uses feature-based architecture. Each feature owns its command entrypoints, supporting runtime code, and feature-specific repository layer under `src/features/`.

## Feature Rules

- Every feature must export `name`, `start(client)`, and `stop()` from its `index.ts`.
- Features are **auto-discovered**; no manual registration is needed. `loadFeatures()` scans feature directories and builds the registry.
- `startAllFeatures(client)` and `stopAllFeatures()` handle per-feature **error isolation** and **health status**. A failing feature does not block others.
- `start(client)` is invoked only after the Discord `ready` event, so feature startup may rely on `client.isReady()` and warmed guild caches.
- `commands/` must contain only public slash command definition files that are auto-loaded by `src/handlers/commandHandler.ts`.
- Internal command logic should live in `application/`.
- Feature-specific persistence access should live in that feature's `repositories/`. Repositories contain **actual SQL queries**, not thin wrappers.
- Prefer explicit supporting folder names such as `integrations/`, `jobs/`, `recording/`, `tracking/`, and feature-owned internal modules like `community/poll/`.
- `commands/` files delegate to `application/`; they must not import `repositories/` or `infrastructure/` directly.
- Features never import each other. Anything two features need belongs in `infrastructure/` or `shared/`.
- `src/infrastructure/` is reserved for truly shared runtime infrastructure, not feature-owned business logic. State that several features read - such as `guild_settings` - is owned here, not by whichever feature happens to provide its UI.
- `src/shared/` contains cross-feature utilities, types, and shared registries such as the help catalog.
- Feature lifecycle hooks take a `FeatureContext` (`{ client, config }`). A feature must not import `env` to start itself.
- Nothing is constructed at import time. A module that needs configuration reads it when it is used or when its owner builds it.
- These rules are enforced by `src/__tests__/architecture.test.ts`, not just documented.

## Layer Architecture

Request flow from slash command to persistence:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph Entry
    commands["commands"]
  end
  subgraph Logic
    application["application"]
  end
  subgraph Data
    repositories["repositories"]
    runtimeFolders["integrations / jobs / recording / tracking / services"]
  end
  subgraph Infrastructure
    database["database (connection)"]
    sharedInfra["guildSettings / audit"]
  end

  commands --> application
  application --> repositories
  application --> runtimeFolders
  application --> sharedInfra
  repositories --> database
  sharedInfra --> database
```

- **commands**: Slash command definitions; delegate to application layer.
- **application**: Command/business logic handlers; orchestrate repositories and supporting runtime folders.
- **repositories**: Database access with real SQL; use `runTransaction()` for multi-table writes.
- **supporting runtime folders**: Feature-owned integrations, background jobs, trackers, recorders, or stateful helpers. Prefer explicit names such as `jobs/`, `recording/`, or `tracking/` over a generic `services/` directory.
- **shared infrastructure**: Cross-feature state and services with their own tables — `guildSettings` (`guild_settings`) and `audit` (`audit_logs`). Features use them; they never depend on a feature.
- **database**: Pure infrastructure under `src/infrastructure/database/`—connection, pragma, transactions, migrations only.

## Database Layer

- `infrastructure/database/` is **pure infrastructure**: connection management, `runTransaction()`, and migrations.
- No business logic or feature-specific queries live here. All SQL lives in feature `repositories/`.
- Migrations are numbered DDL files (`001_steam.ts` … `010_native_polls.ts`) applied by `initializeDatabase()`. They re-run on every boot, so a migration that adds a column checks `PRAGMA table_info` first. The Steam feature has been removed; migrations 001 and 002 are kept untouched for a clean upgrade path, and `005_drop_steam.ts` drops the legacy Steam tables on existing databases.

## Interactions

- Slash commands and events are auto-discovered from `features/*/commands/` and `features/*/events/`.
- Interactive panels use `runComponentPanel()` from `src/shared/utils/panel.ts`, which owns the reply/collect/re-render/expire lifecycle. A panel supplies `render`, `renderDisabled`, and `onComponent`. Every button and select menu in the bot belongs to a panel, so components are collected on the message that created them and never reach the interaction router.

## Middleware

- Cooldown logic lives in `middleware/cooldown/` (cooldownMiddleware + cooldownStore).
- `runMiddleware()` in `middleware/index.ts` runs the pipeline (permissions, cooldown, etc.) before command execution.

## Tests

- Tests are **colocated** with features: each feature has its own `__tests__/` directory.
- Shared test helpers live in `src/__tests__/helpers/`.
- Shared utility tests may live under `src/shared/**/__tests__/`.
- Middleware tests under `middleware/__tests__/` and `middleware/cooldown/__tests__/`.
- Infrastructure tests under `infrastructure/<service>/__tests__/`.

## Composition Root

`src/app/composition.ts` is the single place the running bot is assembled.
`createApp(config, deps)` builds the object graph and returns `start()` and
`stop()`; `src/index.ts` keeps only what belongs to the process — reading
configuration, signal handlers, and last-resort crash reporting. A test
enforces that split (`src/__tests__/architecture.test.ts`).

`deps` defaults to the real collaborators and can be replaced wholesale, so
`src/app/__tests__/composition.test.ts` drives the real startup and shutdown
sequence with fakes instead of mocking module paths. Order is a correctness
property here — the database opens before anything queries it, features start
only after the gateway is ready, and the final backup runs while the
connection is still open — so it is asserted, not assumed.

Features are started with a `FeatureContext` (`{ client, config }`) rather
than importing `env` for themselves, and nothing is constructed at import
time: the voice jobs are built from the config their feature is handed, and
services that must stay module-level (`backupService`,
`connectionManager`) read configuration on first use.

**What is deliberately not injected:** `config` and the database connection.
Both are process-wide resources with an explicit lifecycle (`loadConfig`,
`closeDatabase`), and their consumers are reached through Discord interaction
handlers whose signature the library fixes. Threading them down would mean a
module-level context holder set during startup — the same global with extra
steps and a temporal coupling on top. Tests override both by mocking
`config/index.js` and `database/connection.js`.

## Lifecycle

Startup and shutdown flow:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  main["src/index.ts (config, signals)"] --> createApp["createApp(config)"]
  createApp --> initDb["initializeDatabase()"]
  initDb --> loadFeatures["loadFeatures()"]
  loadFeatures --> loadDiscord["loadCommands() + loadEvents()"]
  loadDiscord --> login["client.login()"]
  login --> ready["ClientReady event"]
  ready --> featureStart["startAllFeatures({ client, config })"]
  featureStart --> backupStart["backupService.start() + startAuditRetention()"]
  backupStart --> running["bot running"]
  running --> shutdown["app.stop()"]
  shutdown --> finalBackup["runBackup() (if SHUTDOWN_FINAL_BACKUP)"]
  finalBackup --> backupStop["backupService.stop() + stopAuditRetention()"]
  backupStop --> featureStop["stopAllFeatures() in reverse order"]
  featureStop --> cooldowns["cooldownStore.clearAll()"]
  cooldowns --> closeDb["closeDatabase()"]
  closeDb --> destroyClient["client.destroy()"]
```

Every shutdown step runs even if an earlier one throws, so a feature that
hangs cannot leave the database open.

## Scripts

- `src/app-scripts/`: TypeScript scripts that operate on the application or Discord state.
- `scripts/` at the repository root: shell scripts for repo workflow such as validation and git hooks.
